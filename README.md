# gaia
gaia is my personal collection of AI model training code. The purpose of Gaia is to learn SOTA AI model architectures and training schemes by implementing them myself and then eventually be able to run
my own training experiments based on this code.

I want to cover LLMs, Multi-modal models, as well as Robotics focused models like VLAs.
